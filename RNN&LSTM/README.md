# RNN & LSTM for Stock Price Prediction  

This project demonstrates how to use **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models for stock price prediction.  

- Uses **Google Stock Price dataset** ðŸ“Š  
- Implements **LSTM layers** with **dropout** for better accuracy  
- Trains a model and **visualizes real vs. predicted stock prices**  

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

## Results  
The model predicts future stock prices based on historical trends.
